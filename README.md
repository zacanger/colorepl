# colorepl

WIP: this doesn't do anything yet.

Node REPL, but with syntax highlighting.

--------

## Usage

`npx colorepl`

Or, if you like to install stuff globally, `npm i -g colorepl`, then `colorepl`.

## Why?

Other languages have nice REPLs! Clojure has Ultra, Python has ptpython, Haskell
has HsColour, and so on. Node's REPL is just a builtin module, which means it
can easily be built on. And I like syntax highlighting, so I wanted this. As far
as I know, the only real REPL (I'm not counting browser-based applications like
Mancy) for Node that had syntax highlighting was this thing called Ultra that
disappeared from Github a while ago, and doesn't even run on modern Node. So,
there's this thing now.
